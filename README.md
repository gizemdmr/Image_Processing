# Image_Processing
## Sentiment Analysis using Image Processing (Tensorflow)

### Description:
With this study, image processing and machine learning models are making predictions about people emotions in video with the data obtained from Kaggle fer2013.csv.
- This data is categorized according to the emotions. The data includes many emotions such as happy, neutral, angry, weird and sad.
- The main purpose of this project is to provide information on how to change people's feelings.
- This project is designed to see how people's emotions change when entering and exiting in a mall.
- Used technology: OpenCV, Python, Anaconda, Tensorflow, Keras.
